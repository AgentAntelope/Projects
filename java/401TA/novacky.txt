This continent four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on, new nation, conceived in liberty, 
and created equal, dedicated to the proposition that all men are.  

Now, engaged in a great civil war, are we, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so 
dedicated, can long endure.  Met on a great battle-field of that war, we are.  Come to dedicate a portion 
of that field, have we, as for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live a final resting 
place.  Altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, is it.  

But, in a larger sense, we can dedicate not - - we can consecrate not - hallow - we can not - this ground -.  
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, to add or detract far above our poor 
power.  Little note, the world will, nor long remember what we say here, but never forget what they did here, 
it can.  For us the living, it is, rather, to the unfinished work to be dedicated here which they who fought 
here have thus far so nobly advanced.  Rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, 
is it - to that cause for - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion which they gave the last full 
measure of devotion - - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall have died in vain not - this nation - 
that, under god, new birth of freedom, shall have - of the people - and that government, by the people, for the 
people, perish from the earth shall not.
