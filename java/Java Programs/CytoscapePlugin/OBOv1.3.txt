comment: Note that while typically associated with tRNA splicing, this mechanism of splicing is known to be used for some non-tRNA substrates, e.g. HAC1 (YFL031W) in S. cerevisiae and an intron in the 23S rRNA of the Archaeal species Desulfurococcus mobilis.

comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron. Note that although the majority of U2-type introns have the sequence GU-AG at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U12-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.

In fungi, the sporocarp (also known as fruiting body) is a multicellular structure on which spore-producing structures, such as basidia or asci, are borne. The fruiting body is part of the sexual phase of a fungal life cycle, with the rest of the life cycle being characterized by vegetative mycelial growth. The sporocarp of a basidiomycete is known as a basidiocarp, while the fruiting body of an ascomycete is known as an ascocarp. A significant range of different shapes and morphologies is found in both basidiocarps and ascocarps; these features play an important role in the identification and taxonomy of fungi."

In S. cerevisiae, this is known to occur for leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. When an aromatic family amino acid, phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan, is used as the substrate, 2-phenylethanol, 4-hydroxyphenylethanol, or tryptophol, respectively, is produced.

[PMID:12837608, PMID:15890982]
comment: Note that podosomes can be distinguished from other F-actin-rich structures or from other matrix contacts. For example, focal adhesions and focal contacts do not display a core structure of F-actin. Unlike focal adhesions, podosome assembly does not require de novo protein synthesis. However, most of the podosome ring components are found in focal adhesions and other cell-matrix contacts. Podosomes are typically found in cells that cross tissue boundaries, recruited to the leading edge of migrating cells, and are often sites of extracellular matrix degradation.

The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.
